# Cryptocurrencies: ***Working with Unsupervised Machine Learning***

## Overview of Project

### Overview

In this project, we are helping Martha convincse her firm named Accountability Accounting to make the decision on investing in cryptocurrencies, and ultimately provide which ones will be worth investing on. We are provided with a dataset of newer,affordable, cryptocurrencies that are worth considering, and we are given the task to create an algorithm that will help us persuade the firm to invest in them.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a clustering algorithm in which we process our data, cluster it, reduce its dimensions, and reduce the data with principal components using the Principal Component Analysis(PCA) approach. After creating this algorithm, we will present our findings using data visualizations that can be used in a presentation to show the company which cryptocurrencies would be ideal to present to its customers as investment.


## Results

We were able to create a clustering algorithm that met all the requirements we were given to cluster our data. For our first visualization, we decided to show how our data was clustered using a 3D plot which uses the three principal components of our algorithm P1, P2, P3 as its axis. In this plot, we show how our data is broken down into 4 different clusters that are symbolized by a different object. The following image shows said plot:

Additionally, we created a table that contains all of the information of the tradable cryptocurrencies. With this table, we were able to find the total amout of tradable cryptocurrencies, which ended up being 532. The following image shows said table:

Lastly, we created a scatter plot using the columns of TotalCoinsMined as our x axis and TotalCoinSupply as our y axis. In this plot, we plotted all of the tradable cryptocurrencies and if we hover over each point, we are able to get the value of both the TotalCoinsMinded and TotalCoinSupply, but additionally, we are able to see the name of that currency. This plot allows us also to look at cryptocurrencies per class. This is a great resource Martha and the company can use to present the cryptocurrencies the customers can pick from for their investment. The following image shows the scatter plot:
